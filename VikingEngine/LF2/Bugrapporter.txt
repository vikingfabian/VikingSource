//nyway I played a bit more, went to a town, tried to buy and sell some stuff, found a "Volcan smith" who had the ability to insert a magic gem in a weapon, which I wasn't able to do as I didn't have any.  He also had the ability to make bombs and I had the ingredients for one, think it was a firebomb.  So I tried to make it, and after selecting all the ingredients the game crashed.  I sent you the callstack using XBox messaging.  So, sorry, it's a fail - guess this update is going to have to drag out a little longer :-p

//Unequipping gear causes a crash 100% of the time, 
//as does crafting bombs from the weapon enchanter (also 100% of the time).

//Constant time-out-style crashes - especially on loading into someone else's world - drain your gold as trying to fast travel back to them, as cheap as it is, cannot compare to the frequency at which the crashes happen.

//NPCs do not appear (such as the cook for the story quest) for numerous log-ins, others disappear completely (20+ restarts and nowhere on my world does the Guard Captain exist anymore to hand in the 3 egg nests I destroyed.

//The starting chest disappears... not sure if that is intentional, but if it is I suggest making a textual notification of that since I was using it to store all of my loot and gold prior to purchase of the game during the tutorial and then the chest vanished two log-ins after said purchase - along with all of my farmed mats and loot.

//Trophy for beating the last boss is given upon killing 2 wizards (may have been triggered via defeat of a specific wizard, to be honest. All I know is that it went off when my two friends and I killed our second one and we all obtained it).

//Enemy fortifications (the tower / parapet ones) render oddly for the host. Stairs go under them, lead to walls, or simply do not exist. This makes the chests obtainable only to players who join sessions.

//Items and mobs can climb onto areas players cannot reach. I'm sure you are aware of this one since the start, but it is quite troublesome and annoying.
