Change Log
* Tab between cities and armies - select added
* Simplified difficulty selection
* Added mercenary cost to difficulty


Error
-cities som inte blir captured
-the horses dont load when paused, plus rotation error
-also path finding of a land army will often prefer water over land when the boat building will cause the travel time to take considerably longer than if it went over land
from what i've seen, this generally only happens if the army is on a land tile immediately adjacent to water

Retreat system
-retreat av de sista motståndarna
-light taunt units (slingers, light cavalry)
-reassemble av flydd arme

Polish
-attack warning -Battle notification
-diplomacy toggle
-end credits
-zoom av diplomacy
//-omplacera workforce hud
-AI sök fiende armeer som passerar
-battlegrid: would it be possible to just not let units move into a water tile if it is a land battle?
-merc cost till difficulty
-dölj move path OnHud
