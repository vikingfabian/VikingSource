Change Log
* Added ai delay to difficulty, reduced economy to 5% during start
* Faster map border update 
* SAVE (beta)!
	To compress the data, a lot of (kinda unessesesary) detail info is lost.
	for example; all battles will restart after load.
	In most cases you wont notice it.
	Expected bugs.

from what i've seen, this generally only happens if the army is on a land tile immediately adjacent to water
