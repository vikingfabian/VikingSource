Error
-also path finding of a land army will often prefer water over land when the boat building will cause the travel time to take considerably longer than if it went over land
from what i've seen, this generally only happens if the army is on a land tile immediately adjacent to water

Retreat system
-retreat av de sista motståndarna
-light taunt units (slingers, light cavalry)
