* Bought some cheap, royalty free music and put it in my game.
* Credits
* End screen for victory or loss, with statistics.
* Prologue: a short "movie" you can watch when you win the game.
* Now saves sound/graphics settings
! Multiscreen setup does not work in save/load
* Save files are split up, now each flag is its own file (for easy share)

! How to restore your lost flag designs: 
C:\Users\name\Documents\My Games\LootfestWars
remove DSS_gameoptions (if there is one)
rename DSS_profiles to DSS_gameoptions
start game, go into flag design and "save & exit" on each flag you want to keep
