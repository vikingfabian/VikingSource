Change Log
* Save issues fixed: guard size, workforce, city names 
* Shift+1/2/3 to backward unit tabbing
* War declaration messages
* Can only loose a city to a faction you are in war with
* Recruit time 4x longer. But halved while adjacent to a city. Recruit strength is reduced to 1/4 (and is about 1/20 of a standard soldier) - in other words: They suck!

* Three factions are fighting a massive, dying war in the east. This is a hidden performance test :)
!Old saves are depricated
